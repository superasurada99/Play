    "Apply the scaling analysis method in Gray and Edwards (2014).\"The avalanche is assumed to be of a typical thickness, $H$, which is much smaller than the downslope length scale, $L$. Typical downstream flow speeds are assumed to be the oder of the gravity wave speed, $ U = \\left( gH \\right)^(1/2)$, and mass balance implies that typical normal velocities in the $z$ direction are of magnitude $ \\varepsilon U$, where the aspect ratio $ \\varepsilon = H/L << 1$.
